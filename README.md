# A libsodium wrapper for Swift 3
Swiftium is a lightweight libsodium wrapper for Swift 3. Only supports the secretbox "easy" functions of libsodium as well as a few of the helper/utility functions.

Tested against libsodium 1.0.11. A precompiled libsodium binary is included with this repo, however I recommend that you compile your own from source. View the install docs for instructions https://download.libsodium.org/doc/installation/.

The source directory is a little messy. I wish groups in Xcode would create a physical folder as well. All of the *.swift files and Swiftium.h are part of the Swiftium library. The rest of the files are libsodiumâ€™s headers and binary files which can be replaced with the ones you download from source and compile.

# Usage example

There isn't too much to Swiftium, but here's a quick start guide. You can view the test script for a few more examples.

### Create a key
    let key = Swiftium.utils.randomBytes(len: SecretBox.keySize)!

### Create instance of Swiftium SecretBox
    let secretBox = SecretBox()

### Encrypt
    let plainText = "Hello World!".toData()!
    let encrypted: NSData = try! secretBox.encrypt(message: plainText, secretKey: key)

### Decrypt
    let decrypted: NSData = try! secretBox.decrypt(nonceMacCipherText: encrypted, secretKey: key)
    print(decrypted) // Should print Hello World!
